=== Why should I care about this module?

For none mono-repositories this module reduces the effort to handle a lot of repositories.
It provides methods to update and maintain already created repositories.

Makes it easy to create a new repository from scratch and set it up with all the files
to have a 'working' module. So it helps to unify all the repos.

Just follow the instructions and give it a try.
